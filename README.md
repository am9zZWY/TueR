***TÃ¼R** â€“ **TÃ¼**bingen **R**etrieval. The door to TÃ¼bingen.*

This project consists of two main components: the [Engine](engine/README.md) and the [Client](client/README.md). In the linked READMEs you will find a detailed guide to help you understand and get started with each component.

The Engine is responsible for the backend processing and consists of several key modules.

The Client is the frontend of the application, built using Vue.js. It provides a user interface for interacting with the Engine.
